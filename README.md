# css3-image-hover-effects
###Image hover effects based only on CSS3 and HTML5

In every project a few image hover effects are needed so I decided to gather some of them. This collection is the result of the most common effects that I use and a few experiments.

Over 25 effects are included and more will be added form time to time.

###Usage
This package includes the original, SASS files (SCSS syntax), the Gulp set up and the result files.

Each effect is contained in a separate SASS file, in order to make things easier for you, and each tab is contained in a separate html file.

You can preview the result [here](http://hover-effects.ck-experiments.com).

###Local Preview
In order to view this package in a local environment please use firefox, as Chrome does not allow loading local files, or use a local sever (WAMP, MAMP etc...)
